An AI for emotion recognition from text

The AI system is designed to analyze text for emotion recognition and sentiment analysis. Using advanced NLP techniques, including tokenization, stop-word removal, and embedding with models like BERT, it identifies patterns in the text and maps them to predefined emotion categories (e.g., joy, sadness, anger). The system leverages co-occurrence graphs and PF-IEF scoring for pattern weight calculation, enriching its ability to discern emotions with high accuracy. Additionally, it incorporates pretrained GloVe embeddings for contextual pattern enrichment, providing a robust tool for real-world sentiment applications.
